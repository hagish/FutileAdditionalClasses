FutileAdditionalClasses
=======================

Classes to do things I want in Futile, that may not yet be a part of the official repo.

FAnimation: Holds frames, timing, and looping information.

FAnimatingSprite: Extends FSprite to display animating image. Add multiple FAnimations, then call them with play(NAME);

BurgleGame.cs, Burglar.png, and Burglar.txt are example files for your Unity project.
