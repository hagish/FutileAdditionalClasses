FutileAdditionalClasses
=======================

Classes to do things I want in Futile, that may not yet be a part of the official repo.

FAnimation: Holds frames, timing, and looping information.

FAnimatingSprite: Extends FSprite to display animating image. Add multiple FAnimations, then call them with play(NAME);

FTilemap: Extends FContainer, creates an array of FSprites based on a comma separated text file (csv).

Fonts: I added two fonts for use in Futile projects. These are meant to be pixel fonts (be sure to set Fonts.png filtering to Point), drawn by myself. Feel free to use these in your projects, credit appreciated.

BurgleGame.cs is an example file for your Unity project which includes uses of the other files and classes.
